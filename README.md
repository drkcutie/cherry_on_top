## 🗒️ Project Overview

RESIKLO is an AI-driven waste reduction and tracking platform designed to make sustainable living effortless and engaging. Using an AI-powered waste scanner, users can upload photos of waste, and the system will identify the best disposal method based on type and confidence level, using YOLO for object detection. Users can track their personal waste reduction score over time, compete on leaderboards, and participate in social challenges, much like Strava. Additionally, Resiklo AI can partner with organizations and businesses to offer rewards—such as vouchers or discounts—in exchange for waste contributions, like collecting 50 used 500ml water bottles for exclusive perks, making sustainability more rewarding.

### Functional Requirements

🔑 The system must accept images taken from the camera directly.

🔑 The system must calculate a waste reduction score based on waste type, confidence level, and unit count.

🔑 The leaderboard must update in real-time based on users’ waste contributions.

🔑 The rewards system must track waste submissions and integrate with partnered businesses for voucher distribution.
